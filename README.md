# Vigenere Encryption

Its a super simple encryption system. It was mostly used during WW1. But now its outdated

It requires Python 3.

1. Enter the plain text in plain_text.txt and run encrypt.py, the encrypted text should be outputted in encrypted_text.txt

2. Run the decrypt.py and the decrypted text should be outputted in decrypted_text.txt

Enjoy!
